# Augmented-Reality
<b>Markerless Augmented Reality and its experimentation</b>

This was implemented as part of my final project for my undergraduation. Experimented different approaches to implement markerless augmented reality. Used SURF and SIFT algorithms for key point detection. FLANN matching libraries for matching key points in two images.

<b>Tools and Technologies:</b> Python, Pyscripter.
